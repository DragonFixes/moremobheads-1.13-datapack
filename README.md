# moremobheads-1.13-datapack
This is an updated version of Xisuma's More Mob Heads datapack that works on 1.13+ servers and clients.

To enable the datapack, copy the moremobheads directory into the "datapacks" directory inside your world directory. If your server is running, make sure to run /reload.
